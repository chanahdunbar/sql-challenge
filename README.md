# SQL Challenge

My first major task was to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data where I then performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

## Data Modeling and Engineering
I've included the model of data called QuickDBD-Free Diagram.png. It outlines the tables being used, their primary and foreign keys, their columns, and how they are all connected to one another.

## Data Analysis
In the analysis portion of the challenge, the steps I took include:
- Listing the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
- Listing the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
- Listing the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
- Listing the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- Listing first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
- Listing each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
- Listing each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- Listing the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
